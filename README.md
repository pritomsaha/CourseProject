Our program was built in a Jupyter notebook and ran on Google Colab. There are two colab file: 
1. Corpus Processing: It is used to get text corpus and preprocessing the text.
2. ITMTF: This is the main colab where the ITMTF model is run sequencially.

Please see the comments we added inline for instructions on running specific blocks of code. The code blocks can be run sequentially from beginning to end to see the results. Please see the Documentation.pdf for more details.
